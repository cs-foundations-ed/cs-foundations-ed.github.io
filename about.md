The foundations of computing are the mathematics that underlie computer science and its related disciplines.
In this blog, we discuss how the two fields—computer science and mathematics—are related, how these relations work out in practice for computing professionals, and how educators can best teach these foundations across the computing curriculum.

## Mailing List

The computing foundations education blog is part of a revival of the [Math in Computer Science Working Group](http://www.math-in-cs.org/) which brought together computer science educators interested in applying mathematical thinking across the computer science curriculum.  In addition to the [SIGCSE mailing list](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/membership/mailing-lists), if you are interested in keeping in touch with news and discussion related to foundations education, we recommend joining the math-in-cs mailing list:
